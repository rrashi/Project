# Run Girlie Run

This is a personal project based on "Pong" written by Colton Ogden(https://github.com/games50/pong). I was inspired to make my own version after viewing his lecture as part of the Games50 series. The sprites and the background are self made. Many integral concepts like implementation of OOP in lua, parallax scrolling, tracking user input, procedural generation, as well as the utilization of the "push" class have been adapted from Pong and from whatever I gained through the lecture.
